# KotlinTaskManager

# Overview

This project is a console-based task manager application written in Kotlin. The application allows users to efficiently manage their tasks by providing features such as adding tasks, removing tasks, listing all tasks, marking tasks as completed, and filtering tasks by category. 

The purpose of writing this software was to deepen my understanding of the Kotlin language and its syntax, including its features for collections, data classes, and control flow structures like `when`. Additionally, the project helped reinforce concepts like file handling and dynamic collection management.

# Development Environment

I developed the software using the Kotlin programming language and the Java Development Kit (JDK). The development environment was Visual Studio Code, equipped with the Kotlin Language extension for coding and debugging. The program relied on Kotlin's standard library for file handling and thread management but avoided using any external libraries to ensure simplicity and portability.

# Future Work

- Improve error handling for user input to make the program more robust.
- Add the ability to edit task details after creation.
- Enhance the user interface by introducing colored console output for better readability.
- Implement task prioritization and sorting based on deadlines or categories.
